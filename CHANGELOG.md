  - Unit tests for all major functions
  - Test fixtures for reusable test data
  - Mock support for file operations
  - Data integrity and edge case tests
  - Coverage for data loading, preparation, training, evaluation, and prediction

- **CHANGELOG.md**: Version history and change tracking
  - Following Keep a Changelog format
  - Semantic versioning adherence

#### Changed
- **Refactored main script**: sonar_analysis.py (renamed from "Sonar Data Analysis (Critical Object Prediction).py")
  - Modular function-based architecture
  - Clear separation of concerns:
    - `load_sonar_data()`: Data loading with error handling
    - `explore_data()`: Exploratory data analysis
    - `prepare_data()`: Data preparation and splitting
    - `train_model()`: Model training
    - `evaluate_model()`: Model evaluation with metrics
    - `predict_object()`: Prediction interface
    - `main()`: Orchestration of the pipeline
  - Comprehensive docstrings (Google style)
  - PEP8 compliant formatting
  - Type hints where applicable
  - Improved error handling and user feedback

- **README.md**: Complete overhaul with professional documentation
  - Added badges (Python version, license, code style, maintenance)
  - Quick start guide with installation instructions
  - Usage examples with code snippets
  - Dataset information and source attribution (UCI ML Repository)
  - Project structure visualization
  - Testing instructions
  - Model performance metrics
  - Development setup guidelines
  - Contribution guidelines with workflow
  - Potential applications and use cases
  - References and acknowledgments

#### Fixed
- Code formatting issues (now PEP8 compliant)
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Missing error handling in data loading
- Lack of code documentation

#### Technical Details
- **Lines of code**: Expanded from ~100 to ~250+ (including documentation)
- **Test coverage**: Added comprehensive test suite
- **Code quality**: Implemented linting and automated quality checks
- **Documentation**: Added docstrings to all functions
- **Modularity**: Refactored monolithic script into reusable functions
